<h3><a href="https://johnlian.net/posts/hdmi-cec/">Fix HDMI-CEC weirdness with a Raspberry Pi and a $7 cable</a> • 192pts 100c</h3>
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46281060">HN discussion</a>
<p class="TLDR">TLDR: Author uses a Raspberry Pi as a "CEC shepherd" to fix audio routing issues between his Samsung TV and Denon receiver. The Pi monitors the HDMI-CEC bus, watches for console activity, and automatically sends commands to wake the receiver when the TV and consoles fail to communicate properly. Classic case of solving a problem manufacturers should have fixed.</p>
<p class="Take">Take: We've reached peak home automation when debugging your living room requires wireshark-level packet analysis of your HDMI bus. The consoles "missed the last week of CEC school" is charitable; they never enrolled.</p>
<p class="Comments">Comments:</p>
<ul><li>"Modern AV stuff is insane. I have no interest in taking it up as a hobby... Luckily, I have one of the last remaining TVs with a headphone jack" -recursive</li>
<li>"HDMI-CEC apparently can only support like 3 console-like devices. I have an Apple TV, Nintendo Switch 2, Sound Bar and PS5 hooked up, but only 3 can really interact" -davidczech</li>
<li>"I used a similar setup to translate CEC user commands... the pi had a shell script that reads all the loglines coming from cec-client" -nullhole</li></ul>

<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46279187">HN discussion</a>
<p class="TLDR">TLDR: Umbrel is a self-hosted home cloud OS that lets you run Bitcoin nodes, Plex, Nextcloud, and AI models locally. Comes as a plug-and-play device starting at $499 with up to 4TB SSD. One-click app store for self-hosting various services, emphasizing data ownership and privacy.</p>
<p class="Take">Take: The eternal tension of self-hosting: everyone wants to "own their data" until they realize owning data means owning servers, updates, backups, and the anxiety that comes with being your own IT department. At $499, Umbrel is betting you'll pay Apple money for the privilege of doing Apple's job yourself.</p>
<p class="Comments">Comments:</p>
<ul><li>"I am uninterested in purchasing proprietary hardware running a proprietary operating system... you can't extend it without their proprietary app store" -bastawhiz</li>
<li>"A decade of personal cloud box attempts has shown the hard part isn't the hardware, it's the long-term social contract... once the company pivots or dies, you're left with a sealed brick" -pedrozieg</li>
<li>"I like Umbrel's technical approach: Its apps are just docker compose files with a little extra... I did not like the reliability around app installations" -solarkraft</li></ul>

<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46281944">HN discussion</a>
<p class="TLDR">TLDR: [From title + comments, article behind paywall] A JetBlue flight nearly collided with a US Air Force jet, reportedly because the military aircraft had its transponder turned off. After this near miss, there was another incident the following day involving a business jet. Dutch airspace appears to have been involved.</p>
<p class="Take">Take: Military operations require secrecy, sure, but there's a difference between operational security and "let's turn off the thing that stops us from hitting civilian aircraft full of people." The fact that AWACS can track civilian traffic but apparently nobody thought to, you know, coordinate, is impressive in the worst way.</p>
<p class="Comments">Comments:</p>
<ul><li>"Why was the Air Force plane's transponder turned off? This is negligence that almost killed a plane full of people and endangered a national security operation" -pradmatic</li>
<li>"The US could issue a notice of an Alert Area where military operations are in progress AND could coordinate with Dutch airspace authorities" -BXLE_1-1-BitIs1</li>
<li>"After the near miss from JetBlue, there was another near miss with a business jet yesterday morning" -maxboone</li></ul>

<h3><a href="https://hpjansson.org/chafa/">Chafa: Terminal Graphics for the 21st Century</a> • 110pts 19c</h3>
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46278208">HN discussion</a>
<p class="TLDR">TLDR: Chafa is a terminal graphics tool that renders images and GIFs using Sixels, Kitty, iTerm2 protocols, or Unicode mosaics. Supports truecolor, 256-color, and 16-color modes with alpha transparency. SIMD optimized and multithreaded for speed. Works with CJK fullwidth characters for better visual fidelity.</p>
<p class="Take">Take: In 2025 we're still impressed when terminals can display pictures without looking like a corrupted fax. Chafa is genuinely good at this, which says more about the state of terminal graphics than anything else. Somewhere, a sysadmin is using this to preview cat pictures over SSH and feeling very productive.</p>
<p class="Comments">Comments:</p>
<ul><li>"I've been trying for like three hours to get this to show in-line images with w3m" -cherrycreek00</li>
<li>"I learned about Chafa when I found a video editor that runs in the command line with keyboard control - vic - it just lets you insert split markers" -jazzyjackson</li>
<li>"I use chafa extensively, and it really is the best tool for terminal graphics... I use it as a fallback option for terminals without proper terminal graphics support" -joouha</li></ul>

<h3><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adx7892">Cosmic-ray bath in a past supernova gives birth to Earth-like planets</a> • 81pts 29c</h3>
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46277090">HN discussion</a>
<p class="TLDR">TLDR: [From title + comments, article behind paywall] New research suggests that cosmic rays from nearby supernovas played a crucial role in forming Earth-like planets by helping create heavier elements. The standard model has stars producing elements up to iron, with supernovas scattering those elements and creating heavier ones through their explosions.</p>
<p class="Take">Take: Every atom heavier than iron in your body was forged in stellar explosions. Your gold wedding ring is supernova debris. Your phone's rare earth elements are cosmic violence crystallized. And yet people complain about their commute.</p>
<p class="Comments">Comments:</p>
<ul><li>"Why is it said that it takes a supernova to make elements heavier than iron? You're not going to get iron-iron fusion, but what about proton-iron fusion?" -phkahler</li>
<li>"The Universe coalesced into hydrogen and helium from a quark-gluon plasma soon after the Big Bang. It's kind of staggering the sequence of events that occurred afterwards to bring us here" -jmyeet</li></ul>

<strong>Highlights</strong>

<li>Let's Encrypt: certificates getting shorter because apparently 90 days was too easy</li>
<li>Ford: electric trucks are over, range-extender hybrids are the new hotness</li>

<h3><a href="https://ericdaigle.ca/posts/super-secure-maga-messaging-app-leaks-everyones-phone-number/">Super Secure Messaging App Leaks Everyone's Phone Number</a> • 496pts 232c</h3>
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46279123">HN discussion</a>
<p class="TLDR">TLDR: Freedom Chat, a messaging app marketing itself as ultra-secure, had two devastating flaws: every user's PIN was broadcast to all channel members, and the contact discovery API could be enumerated to leak all registered phone numbers in about 27 hours. The CEO previously ran another app called Converso that had similar issues.</p>
<p class="Take">Take: Nothing says "secure" like broadcasting your PIN to everyone in the room. The real comedy is that Freedom Chat previously mocked WhatsApp for the exact same vulnerability. This is what happens when security is a marketing checkbox rather than an engineering discipline.</p>
<p class="Comments">Comments:</p>
<ul><li>"It literally takes a line to implement rate-limiting in Nginx. How do you ship an API without this?" -ericmcer</li>

<h3><a href="https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/upcoming-changes-to-let-s-encrypt-certificates/243873">Upcoming Changes to Let's Encrypt Certificates</a> • 225pts 192c</h3>
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46279241">HN discussion</a>
<p class="TLDR">TLDR: Let's Encrypt is rolling out new root/intermediate certificates, dropping TLS client authentication support in Feb 2026, and progressively shortening certificate lifetimes from 90 to 64 days (2027) then 45 days (2028). This follows a CA/Browser Forum vote mandating 47-day max certificates.</p>
<p class="Take">Take: The internet's favorite certificate authority is making certificates expire faster than my motivation on Monday mornings. Sure, shorter lifetimes improve security, but this also makes Let's Encrypt a bigger single point of failure. If their systems hiccup for two weeks, a lot of the web goes dark.</p>
<p class="Comments">Comments:</p>
<ul><li>"These short lifetimes make Let's Encrypt a central point of failure for much of the Internet" -Animats</li>
<li>"This isn't LE's decision - a 47 day max was voted on by the CA/Browser Forum" -btown</li>
<li>"I'm kind of done with unnecessary policy ratcheting. Same with rotating passwords with 2FA, no one can justify it" -ottah</li></ul>

<h3><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ford-kills-electric-f-150-lightning-for-hybrid/">Ford Kills the All-Electric F-150 Lightning</a> • 118pts 148c</h3>
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46281182">HN discussion</a>
<p class="TLDR">TLDR: [from title + comments, article behind paywall] Ford is discontinuing the pure-electric F-150 Lightning and pivoting to an extended-range electric vehicle (EREV) architecture that uses a combustion engine as a range extender. The company cites profitability concerns and customer feedback about range anxiety.</p>
<p class="Take">Take: Ford tried to out-Tesla Tesla with an electric truck, discovered that small businesses actually need trucks that can tow without halving their range, and retreated to hybrids. The Lightning was impressive tech but priced like a luxury item for working vehicles. Sometimes the market speaks louder than the mission statement.</p>
<p class="Comments">Comments:</p>
<ul><li>"The price isn't right for small businesses. These trucks are expensive and designed like iPhones to be disposable" -exabrial</li>
<li>"I see a lot of them in Metro Vancouver where electricity is cheap and gas expensive" -izend</li>
<li>"Looking at Ford's press release, they're calling the next-gen an 'extended-range electric vehicle'" -hnburnsy</li></ul>

<h3><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/secret-documents-show-pepsi-and-walmart">Secret Documents Show Pepsi and Walmart Colluded to Raise Food Prices</a> • 130pts 32c</h3>
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46280887">HN discussion</a>
<p class="TLDR">TLDR: An FTC complaint alleges Pepsi gave Walmart preferential pricing, promotional allowances, and store placement while maintaining higher wholesale prices for everyone else. Pepsi tracked "price gaps" between Walmart and competitors, and punished retailers like Food Lion for trying to match Walmart's prices. A Pepsi CFO bragged in 2022 they could "take whatever pricing we need."</p>
<p class="Take">Take: "Keep us the king of our domain and we'll make you the king of yours" reads like dialogue from a mob movie, except the mobsters are selling chips and soda. Price discrimination laws exist for a reason, and that reason is exactly this. The real victims are the smaller grocers who can't play ball.</p>
<p class="Comments">Comments:</p>
<ul><li>"The bigger the company, the more power to dictate prices. Same with Amazon" -yndoendo</li>
<li>"Pepsi raised prices by double digits for seven quarters - and people kept buying junk food anyway" -GenerWork</li>

<h3><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11146">A Quarter of US-Trained Scientists Eventually Leave</a> • 101pts 113c</h3>
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46280080">HN discussion</a>
<p class="TLDR">TLDR: Research using data from 1980-2024 shows 25% of US-trained STEM PhD graduates leave within 15 years. Leave rates are higher in AI and quantum science, lower in life sciences. Even after leaving, US patent citations to their work only drop from 70% to 50% - still five times larger than the destination country's share.</p>
<p class="Take">Take: The US trains world-class scientists, then makes it hard for international students to stay and unappealing for domestic ones to remain in academia. At least we keep citing their work after they leave, which is a weird consolation prize. The real story is why: too few faculty positions for too many PhDs.</p>
<p class="Comments">Comments:</p>
<ul><li>"The number of students needed for research vastly exceeds junior faculty positions available" -msteffen</li>
<li>"I believe there will be a significant discontinuity in this data starting 2025" -rolandr</li>
<li>"The most lucrative tuition source is foreign students whose parents believe in the American Dream" -travisgriggs</li></ul>

<h3><a href="https://andyatkinson.com/avoid-uuid-version-4-primary-keys">Avoid UUID Version 4 Primary Keys</a> • 164pts 174c</h3>
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46272487">HN discussion</a>
<p class="TLDR">TLDR: UUID v4 as primary keys cause random index page splits, terrible cache hit ratios, and use 2x the space of bigint. The author recommends plain integers for most cases, or UUIDv7 if you absolutely need UUIDs. Postgres 18 will have native UUIDv7 support.</p>
<p class="Take">Take: Every few months HN rediscovers that random data insertion patterns are bad for B-trees. Meanwhile, half the comments are "but distributed systems!" and the other half are "just use Postgres sequences like it's 1999." Both are correct for their contexts, which is exactly why this debate will never end.</p>
<p class="Comments">Comments:</p>
<ul><li>"A prime example of premature optimization. Permanent identifiers should not carry data." -vintermann</li>
<li>"This is incredibly database-specific. In distributed databases like Cockroach and Spanner, monotonic PKs are bad." -stickfigure</li>
<li>"UUIDv7 still seems like a reasonable compromise for small-to-medium databases." -benterix</li></ul>

<h3><a href="https://martinalderson.com/posts/ai-agents-are-starting-to-eat-saas/">AI agents are starting to eat SaaS</a> • 257pts 268c</h3>
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46268452">HN discussion</a>
<p class="TLDR">TLDR: AI agents let engineers build custom internal tools faster than buying SaaS, threatening back-office tools with basic CRUD logic. High-uptime infrastructure and platforms with network effects are safer. The author argues maintenance burden is decreasing as AI can help sustain custom software.</p>
<p class="Take">Take: SaaS founders nervously refreshing their NRR dashboards as their customers realize "we could just vibe-code this." The article makes good points but undersells how much enterprises love paying for someone else to be responsible when things break. Blame deflection is priceless.</p>
<p class="Comments">Comments:</p>
<ul><li>"The thesis doesn't match my experience. Our end users can't build their own tools. Their current system is Excel." -benzible</li>
<li>"I'm seeing the opposite. AI is increasing demand for bespoke integrations that were previously too expensive." -jillesvangurp</li>

<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46275079">HN discussion</a>
<p class="TLDR">TLDR: [From title + comments, article behind paywall] Farmers across the US are developing Parkinson's disease at elevated rates and blaming paraquat, a widely-used herbicide. The pesticide has been linked to neurological damage in multiple studies, but remains legal in the US despite being banned in the EU and China.</p>
<p class="Take">Take: The regulatory capture is so complete that a chemical banned in 60+ countries keeps getting rubber-stamped here. Comments mention "Cancer Alley" and similar corporate malfeasance patterns. At some point "but the economy" stops being a valid excuse for poisoning the people who grow our food.</p>

<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46270282">HN discussion</a>
<p class="TLDR">TLDR: Unscii is a set of bitmapped Unicode fonts designed for blocky graphics and terminal use. Available in 8x8 and 8x16 pixel sizes with "tall," "thin," and "fantasy" variants. Created by studying classic system fonts from Amiga, C64, and Atari to support legacy pseudographic characters and character cell art.</p>
<p class="Take">Take: Finally, a font that lets my terminal look like my Commodore 64 while still supporting emoji. The effort to map hundreds of legacy computing characters to Unicode is genuinely impressive. For the "I deploy apps via ncurses" crowd, this is catnip.</p>

<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46270386">HN discussion</a>
<p class="TLDR">TLDR: Author built Lexie, a minimalist language learning app where the entire UI is a single animated blob character, like a Tamagotchi. No progress bars, no test screens, no shame mechanics. Designed for drilling fundamentals with emotional feedback through subtle animations, specifically to prep for moving to French-speaking Québec.</p>
<p class="Take">Take: Duolingo commodified guilt and called it gamification. This app replaces the passive-aggressive owl with a blob that just... exists. The HN comments predictably contain someone who learned Italian through 200 grammar exercises per paragraph, proving there are as many "correct" ways to learn a language as there are people who failed at Duolingo.</p>
<p class="Comments">Comments:</p>
<ul><li>"I learned Italian the hardest way, doing grammar exercises with 200 sentences per paragraph. I abandoned flashcards on the 2nd month." -culebron21</li>
<li>"I'm not a fan of this style. It seems like Duolingo with a different interface. I had good success with languagetransfer.org" -fainpul</li>
<li>"The ideal language learning app should have a HUGE repository of raw materials written by native speakers." -raincole</li></ul>

<p class="TLDR">TLDR: iRobot, the MIT-founded company that invented robot vacuums, filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy and is being taken over by its Chinese supplier Shenzhen PICEA Robotics. Stockholders get wiped out. Amazon's failed $1.4B acquisition attempt last year apparently didn't help.</p>

<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46268709">HN discussion</a>

<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46265362">HN discussion</a>
<p class="TLDR">TLDR: Adafruit founder Limor Fried argues Arduino's new Terms and Conditions violate open source principles by restricting reverse engineering of cloud tools and adding field-of-use restrictions. The core issue: you can't call something open source if you add usage restrictions like "no military purposes" - that defeats the entire point.</p>

<p class="TLDR">TLDR: A deep dive into why protein folding was biology's hardest problem for 50 years and how DeepMind's AlphaFold essentially solved it in 2020. NVIDIA leveraged their gaming GPU architecture for parallel processing in biological research, making protein structure prediction 138x faster with tools like BioNeMo.</p>

<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46178966">HN discussion</a>
<p class="TLDR">TLDR: The talipot palm only blooms once between ages 40-80, producing a massive floral plume with millions of tiny flowers, then dies. Landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx planted them in Flamengo Park in the 1960s, and now they're all flowering simultaneously - a once-in-a-lifetime botanical event.</p>

<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46270298">HN discussion</a>
<p class="TLDR">TLDR: A syntax highlighting library built on tree-sitter supporting 96 languages with actual code parsing (not regex).
