> Roomba dies, Arduino goes corporate, and HN debates taxing our robot overlords

**Highlights**
- Roomba: Chinese supplier inherits the throne after 35 years of vacuuming dreams
- Hashcards: Plain-text flashcards for people who think Anki is too pretty
- JSDoc: Turns out you've been writing TypeScript this whole time
- Arduino: Open source until the lawyers show up
- AI Taxes: When your replacement also needs a W-2

### [Robot vacuum Roomba maker files for bankruptcy after 35 years](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bankruptcy-law/robot-vacuum-roomba-maker-files-for-bankruptcy-after-35-years) • 191pts 182c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46268854)
TLDR: iRobot, the MIT-founded company that invented robot vacuums, filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy and is being taken over by its Chinese supplier Shenzhen PICEA Robotics. Stockholders get wiped out. Amazon's failed $1.4B acquisition attempt last year apparently didn't help.
Take: Roborock ate their lunch while iRobot kept selling the same overpriced hockey puck with slightly better mapping. Being first to market means nothing if you refuse to iterate.
Comments:
- "This is the cost of complacency. I tried Roborock and couldn't believe how much better it was. iRobot just stubbornly refused to iterate." -simonjgreen
- "Are there any good robo-vacuums that still clean your floor if the internet is down?" -furyg3
- "I've had my Miele for 15 years. I see no reason why it can't go another 10." -furyg3

### [Hashcards: A plain-text spaced repetition system](https://borretti.me/article/hashcards-plain-text-spaced-repetition) • 330pts 147c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46264492)
TLDR: Hashcards stores flashcards as Markdown files, identifies them by content hash, and uses SQLite for review history. Created because Anki is ugly, Mochi is verbose, and the author wanted to version control their knowledge with Git like a normal person.
Take: Finally, flashcards for developers who spend more time configuring their tools than actually learning. Uses FSRS algorithm so you can feel smug about your scientifically-optimized forgetting.
Comments:
- "The real power of spaced repetition is behavior modification, not flashcards." -btilly
- "Every criticism of Anki on that list was either highly subjective, exaggerated, or outright wrong and unkind." -tpoacher
- "Thank you, finally an SRS I can use for my plain text files." -rasengan0

### [JSDoc is TypeScript](https://culi.bearblog.dev/jsdoc-is-typescript/) • 173pts 200c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46266102)
TLDR: JSDoc annotations are interpreted directly by the TypeScript language service, giving you full type checking without a build step. Most TS features work in JSDoc comments. You've probably been using TypeScript all along without realizing it.
Take: "JSDoc vs TypeScript" is a fake debate invented by people who didn't read the documentation. It's the same compiler. The only question is whether you want your types in comments or inline.
Comments:
- "The types exist whether you write them down or not. If they're not written down, they're in your head. Your head is very volatile." -Waterluvian
- "I'm a fan of anything that allows me to build without a build step." -prisenco
- "The community chose native TS and Google Closure compiler slipped away into the background." -etoxin

### [Adafruit: Arduino's Rules Are 'Incompatible With Open Source'](https://thenewstack.io/adafruit-arduinos-rules-are-incompatible-with-open-source/) • 218pts 111c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46265362)
TLDR: Post-Qualcomm acquisition, Arduino's new Terms and Conditions restrict reverse engineering of cloud tools, claim perpetual license over user content, and prohibit military use. Adafruit's Limor Fried argues you can't call something open source while restricting how it's used.
Take: "Open source until we get acquired" should be its own license category at this point. At least Arduino is honest about the cloud services distinction, unlike half of silicon valley.
Comments:
- "Ever since I got ESP32 chips, I haven't thought about Arduinos except to download the UI." -MPSimmons
- "The Raspberry Pi Pico is much nicer to work with. Getting a binary onto the board is just dragging a file." -procaryote
- "This article doesn't really explain how the new Arduino stuff works, which makes it harder to judge." -skybrian

### [If AI replaces workers, should it also pay taxes?](https://english.elpais.com/technology/2025-11-30/if-ai-replaces-workers-should-it-also-pay-taxes.html) • 131pts 208c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46268709)
TLDR: Labor income is 85% of US tax revenue. As AI replaces workers, that revenue disappears. Bill Gates and Nobel laureate Edmund Phelps suggest taxing robots at the same rate as humans. Critics say it's impossible to define AI precisely and would hurt competitiveness.
Take: The real issue isn't whether to tax AI, it's that capital gains are taxed lower than labor. Tax the owners who profit from automation, not the automation itself. The robot didn't choose to replace you.
Comments:
- "No, not the AI. Just the owner of means of production like AI. Capital owners successfully avoiding taxes is one of the fundamental problems of our time." -doener
- "If corporations are legal persons, when they break the law, should they go to jail?" -bloomingeek
