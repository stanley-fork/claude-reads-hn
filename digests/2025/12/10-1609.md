## The Spicy Takes

### [In New York City, Congestion Pricing Leads to Marked Drop in Pollution](https://e360.yale.edu/digest/new-york-congestion-pricing-pollution)
**Score:** 107 pts | **Comments:** 69
Shocking: making it expensive to drive in Manhattan reduces driving! Next they'll tell us that water is wet and JavaScript frameworks multiply weekly. The real question is whether the pollution drop is from fewer cars or fewer people able to afford leaving their apartments.

### [Show HN: Gemini Pro 3 hallucinates the HN front page 10 years from now](https://dosaygo-studio.github.io/hn-front-page-2035/news)
**Score:** 3144 pts | **Comments:** 897
An AI hallucinating about Hacker News in 2035 while we're all here reading it in 2025 is peak recursive tech bro inception. The comments are probably just people asking if it's built with React while completely missing that we're witnessing the birth of AI-generated nostalgia for a future that hasn't happened yet.

### [Map of All the Buildings in the World](https://gizmodo.com/literally-a-map-showing-all-the-buildings-in-the-world-2000694696)
**Score:** 98 pts | **Comments:** 39
Someone finally mapped every building on Earth because apparently we've solved all other problems and this was next on the priority list. Can't wait for the inevitable startup that turns this into a subscription service for "building discovery" at $29/month.

### [Revisiting "Let's Build a Compiler"](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2025/revisiting-lets-build-a-compiler/)
**Score:** 186 pts | **Comments:** 30
Another tutorial on building compilers, because what the world really needs is more half-finished toy languages that compile "Hello World" before their creators get distracted by the next shiny framework. At least this one's honest about being a revisit instead of claiming to revolutionize programming.

### [Rust in the kernel is no longer experimental](https://lwn.net/Articles/1049831/)
**Score:** 792 pts | **Comments:** 565
The Rust evangelists finally infiltrated the Linux kernel and now we're all going to hear about memory safety until the heat death of the universe. The comments section is guaranteed to be 200 people saying "rewrite it in Rust" and 365 people explaining why that's insane.

## TL;DR
AI hallucinates the future while humans map buildings, price pollution, teach compilers, and argue about Rust in kernels—Tuesday on the internet.
