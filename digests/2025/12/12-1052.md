### [Google de-indexed Bear Blog and I don't know why](https://journal.james-zhan.com/google-de-indexed-my-entire-bear-blog-and-i-dont-know-why/) • 168pts 63c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46239752)
TLDR: Developer's entire Bear Blog mysteriously vanished from Google's search results after a Search Console validation attempt, despite being indexed normally on other search engines. After extensive troubleshooting with no clear cause found, they migrated to a new subdomain and gave up trying to fix it.
Take: Welcome to the wonderful world of being at the mercy of a single tech company's opaque algorithms. One wrong click and your digital existence gets erased with zero recourse or explanation.

### [The Walt Disney Company and OpenAI Partner on Sora](https://openai.com/index/disney-sora-agreement/) • 231pts 459c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46231493)
TLDR: Disney is making a $1 billion equity investment in OpenAI and will receive warrants to purchase additional equity, as part of a partnership to use Sora for content creation. The deal allows people to generate Disney character videos without copyright issues.
Take: Sam Altman just convinced Disney to pay a billion dollars to let people flood the internet with Mickey Mouse AI videos. That's either genius-level business strategy or the most expensive way to kill your own IP ever invented.

### [Show HN: Sim – Apache-2.0 n8n alternative](https://github.com/simstudioai/sim) • 202pts 46c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46234186)
TLDR: Sim is an open-source visual editor for building agentic workflows with 138 pre-built blocks, trace spans for debugging, native RAG support, and MCP integration. It runs locally via Docker with no execution limits and positions itself as an alternative to n8n for AI workflows.
Take: Finally, someone built a workflow tool that doesn't make you feel like you're configuring a Rube Goldberg machine. The fact that it runs locally without restrictions is actually refreshing in this SaaS-everything world.

- "You can run Sim locally using Docker, with no execution limits or other restrictions. This is big. Thank you." -popalchemist

### [CRISPR fungus: Protein-packed, sustainable, and tastes like meat](https://www.isaaa.org/kc/cropbiotechupdate/article/default.asp?ID=21607) • 156pts 83c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46239629)
TLDR: Researchers used CRISPR to edit Fusarium venenatum fungus, removing two genes to create a more efficient protein source that requires 44% less sugar, produces 88% faster, and has significantly lower environmental impact than traditional meat. The modified fungus achieves up to 60% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to chicken.
Take: Lab-grown meat companies spent billions trying to replicate beef while these scientists just made mushrooms more efficient. Sometimes the answer isn't to reinvent the wheel, just edit the one nature already gave us.
Comments:
- "while the paper is behind a pay wall, the abstract highlights that they used knock out gene editing, meaning this is not a GMO of the old days" -anotherpaul

### [Journalism students expose Russian-linked vessels off the Dutch and German coast](https://www.digitaldigging.org/p/they-droned-back) • 74pts 43c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46242016)
TLDR: Seven German journalism students tracked Russian-linked ships using open-source intelligence, finding 19 correlations between vessel positions and drone incidents near military installations. Their investigation revealed systematic surveillance patterns with ships positioned during sensitive operations at NATO bases.
Take: College kids with laptops and ship-tracking websites just did what intelligence agencies probably spend millions on. Open source intelligence is democratizing surveillance in ways that would make both spies and dictators very uncomfortable.
