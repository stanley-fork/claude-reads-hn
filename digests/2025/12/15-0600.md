### [Developing a food-safe finish for my wooden spoons](https://alinpanaitiu.com/blog/developing-hardwax-oil/) • 180pts 107c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46224303)
TLDR: Developer spends way too much time perfecting a wood finish recipe: 50g tung oil, carnauba wax, beeswax, lanolin, damar resin, coconut oil, metallic drier, vitamin E. Cures in 48 hours, hydrophobic, food-safe. The kind of obsessive experimentation that makes HN great.
Take: This is peak "I could just buy mineral oil but where's the fun in that" energy. Also the most wholesome thing on HN today, which says something.
Comment: "I treat the spoons I carve with flax oil and roast in a fan oven at 180C, giving a robust coating" -robhlam

### [In the Beginning was the Command Line (1999)](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs81n/command.txt) • 121pts 57c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46189905)
TLDR: Neal Stephenson's legendary essay comparing operating systems to car dealerships. Windows is a station wagon, Mac is a European sedan, Linux is a free tank. Argues GUIs create metaphor layers that distance users from actual computing while making it accessible to Eloi consumers.
Take: 26 years later and the tank is still free but now it has RGB lighting and a package manager that sometimes works. The station wagon has become a subscription service that shows you ads.
Comment: "Still true 25 years later!" -nullbyte808 (referring to Windows hardware looking like white-trash stuff)

### [SoundCloud just banned VPN access](https://old.reddit.com/r/SoundCloudMusic/comments/1pltd19/soundcloud_just_banned_vpn_access/) • 58pts 35c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46269891)
TLDR: SoundCloud started blocking VPN users, breaking access for paying subscribers. Part of a broader trend with HBO Max doing the same. Users are understandably furious since VPNs have legitimate privacy and security uses.
Take: Nothing says "we value our paying customers" like treating them all as potential pirates. This is the streaming industry's favorite self-own.
Comment: "Over five years of paid SoundCloud here, I thought something was wrong with my setup. If this continues I'll have to cancel" -xfeeefeee

### [The Typeframe PX-88 Portable Computing System](https://www.typeframe.net/) • 104pts 33c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46265015)
TLDR: A DIY cyberdeck built around a Raspberry Pi 4 with mechanical keyboard and modular design. "Is it a cyberdeck or a writerdeck? It's whatever you need it to be." Minimal soldering required, designed for people who want to build their own serious portable computer.
Take: Beautiful device that will absolutely end up in a drawer after two weeks because your laptop can do everything better. But those two weeks will feel magical.
Comment: "These kinds of products are drop dead gorgeous. But after many such purchases, I've learned my lesson. My phone, iPad, or laptop can do everything better" -rwl4

### [CapROS: Capability-Based Reliable Operating System](https://www.capros.org/) • 66pts 25c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46268869)
TLDR: An OS that uses capability-based security and orthogonal persistence, descended from EROS and KeyKOS. The project combines 80s ideas about capabilities with modern performance concerns. Sadly appears dormant since 2022.
Take: Intel tried this in 1989 with iAPX 432 and it flopped spectacularly. But the ideas keep coming back because everyone secretly knows flat memory models are held together with duct tape and optimism.
Comment: "Seems like Charlie hasn't been merging pull requests in three years. I wonder if something has happened to him? I hope he's okay." -kragen
