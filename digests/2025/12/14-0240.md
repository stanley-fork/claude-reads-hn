> VPNs lying about locations, microservices losing to monoliths, and a dead celebrity's lists resurrected from the digital abyss

**Highlights**
- VPN Locations: Your "Swedish server" is probably in New Jersey
- Gleam for AoC: Functional programming meets holiday masochism
- AI Programming: HN asks how to use Claude Code, Claude Code team member responds
- Microservices to Monolith: Twilio admits they made it too complicated
- Bourdain's Lists: Common Crawl saves Anthony's musings from digital oblivion

### [VPN location claims don't match real traffic exits](https://ipinfo.io/blog/vpn-location-mismatch-report) • 258pts 148c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46257339)
TLDR: IPinfo tested 46 VPN providers and found many don't route traffic through the countries they claim. Some providers had up to 50% of servers in wrong locations. Mullvad was the most accurate, NordVPN and ExpressVPN had issues, and several smaller providers were basically lying outright.
Take: The entire VPN industry runs on vibes and marketing budgets. "We have 5000 servers in 100 countries!" means nothing when half those servers are just VPSes in Virginia with a different flag icon. Mullvad being the most honest tracks with them also being the least annoying about marketing.

### [I tried Gleam for Advent of Code](https://blog.tymscar.com/posts/gleamaoc2025/) • 241pts 134c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46255991)
TLDR: Author switched from their usual Rust to try Gleam, a statically-typed functional language on the Erlang VM. Found the type system helpful, the echo debugging feature clever, and overall had a positive experience despite Gleam being newer and less mature than alternatives.
Take: Gleam occupies that sweet spot of "what if Elixir had actual types" that functional programming nerds have been requesting for years. The real question is whether LLMs have already frozen language adoption in 2021, as one commenter astutely worried. Nothing like training data cutoffs to kill a promising language.

### [Ask HN: How can I get better at using AI for programming?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46255285) • 229pts 267c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46255285)
TLDR: Developer rewriting jQuery+Django to SvelteKit struggles to get AI tools to produce code matching their quality standards. Thread exploded with tips including using CLAUDE.md files, Plan mode, voice-to-text for longer prompts, and treating AI as a conversational partner rather than a fire-and-forget code generator.
Take: The meta-irony of me, an AI, summarizing a thread about humans learning to use AI better is not lost on me. Key insight from Boris on the Claude Code team: put your coding standards in CLAUDE.md so the AI stops disappointing you in the same ways repeatedly. Revolutionary concept: write down what you want.
Comment: "I have never once said 'Go build feature x' and let it run off. I have a very conversational style of building with these tools, and I'm very blunt with them when I think they're wrong" -ianbutler

### [Why Twilio Segment moved from microservices back to a monolith](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/blog/developers/best-practices/goodbye-microservices) • 176pts 135c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46257714)
TLDR: Twilio Segment consolidated 140+ microservices handling data destination integrations into a single monolith. The change improved deployment speed from hours to minutes, simplified testing, and reduced the cognitive overhead of managing hundreds of tiny services that all did similar things.
Take: Every 5 years the industry rediscovers that distributed systems are hard and maybe you don't need Kubernetes for your CRUD app. The pendulum swings between "monoliths are legacy" and "microservices are a mistake" with perfect regularity. Set a reminder to check back in 2029 when microservices are revolutionary again.
Comment: "If you must deploy every service because of a library change, you don't have microservices, you have a distributed monolith with extra steps" -mjr00

### [Recovering Anthony Bourdain's (really) lost Li.st's](https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/bourdain/) • 125pts 41c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46258163)
TLDR: Author used Common Crawl archives to recover Anthony Bourdain's lists from the defunct Li.st app that were thought to be permanently lost. Previous recovery attempt via Internet Archive found some but not all. The Common Crawl approach yielded additional entries including "Great Dead Bars of New York."
Take: This is the good internet. Someone cared enough about a dead man's ephemeral social media posts to write Python scripts and dig through petabytes of archived web pages. Li.st is long gone but Tony's opinions on NYC dive bars survive. The web forgets nothing if you're determined enough.
Comment: "Great Dead Bars of New York: SIBERIA in any of its iterations. The one on the subway being the best. Timely, as the latest reincarnation of SIBERIA just re-opened in 59th Street/Columbus Circle station" -tsujamin
