## Editor's Picks

### 1. Size of Life
Link: https://neal.fun/size-of-life/
Why it matters: Interactive visualization exploring the scale of life from viruses to blue whales. Neal.fun strikes again with educational content that makes you question your place in the universe while the dynamic soundtrack evolves as you scroll.
Comments:
- "The dynamic soundscape is delightful, as it subtly adds instruments and musical texture as you progress. And going back down the scale regresses it to simple again."
Hot take: Another Neal.fun masterpiece that will consume 2 hours of your day while you pretend it's "educational." The sound design alone makes this more immersive than most AAA games.

### 2. Australia's Social Media Ban for Under-16s
Link: https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/australia-social-media-ban-takes-effect-world-first-2025-12-09/
Why it matters: Australia becomes first country to ban social media for teens under 16. Implementation starts now with fines up to $50M for platforms that don't comply. The real test is whether it actually works or just creates a generation of VPN experts.
Comments:
- "Social media is all about network effects. Once most kids are on there, everyone has to be on there. If you knock the percentage down far enough, you break the network effect."
Hot take: Either this creates the healthiest generation of kids ever, or we just taught an entire nation of teenagers advanced cybersecurity. No middle ground.

### 3. Gemini API Key Frustration
Link: https://ankursethi.com/blog/gemini-api-key-frustration/
Why it matters: Developer tries to get Google Gemini API access, hits bureaucratic nightmare involving multiple APIs, country restrictions, and enterprise sales. Classic Google product confusion strikes again.
Comments:
- "The odd thing about all of this is that when Google AdWords started, one of the notable things about it was that anyone could start serving or buying ads. You just needed a credit-card."
Hot take: Google somehow made getting an API key harder than getting a mortgage. Remember when they used to mock Facebook for being closed? Pepperidge Farm remembers.

### 4. Auto-grading HN Discussions with Hindsight
Link: https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/auto-grade-hn/
Why it matters: Karpathy uses LLMs to grade decade-old HN predictions and discussions based on how things actually turned out. Meta-commentary on our collective ability to predict the future of tech.
Comments:
- "I would install a Chrome extension that shows a score by every username on this site grading how well their expressed opinions match what subsequently happened in reality."
Hot take: Finally, a way to objectively prove that everyone on HN was wrong about everything. Can't wait for someone to build this into a browser extension and destroy all remaining civility.

### 5. Patterns.dev Design Resource
Link: https://www.patterns.dev/
Why it matters: Comprehensive resource for modern web development patterns, from React to performance optimization. Actually useful reference material in an ocean of Medium posts.
Comments:
- "I find that the more senior you become, the less you rely on software design patterns. Juniors often think that learning design patterns is some kind of career hack."
Hot take: Another patterns library to bookmark and never visit again. But honestly, this one actually looks good enough to justify the bookmark pollution.
