> GraphQL wars, AI doomposting, and nostalgic scrobbling into the void

**Highlights**
- GraphQL honeymoon over: enterprise devs discover REST was there all along
- AI automation ironies: humans forget how to human while machines learn
- Last.fm nostalgia: when music discovery meant digging through stranger profiles
- Hashcards: Anki users told their app is bloated, news at 11
- Bot armies priced out: your fake followers cost less than a latte

### [GraphQL: The enterprise honeymoon is over](https://johnjames.blog/posts/graphql-the-enterprise-honeymoon-is-over) • 188pts 164c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46264704)
TLDR: Author argues GraphQL's main selling point of preventing overfetching doesn't hold up in practice. OpenAPI can achieve similar contracts, and GraphQL adds complexity around security, caching, and N+1 queries that enterprises eventually tire of fighting.
Take: Every few years we collectively decide the thing before the new thing was actually fine. GraphQL had its moment, but turns out strongly-typed REST endpoints with good tooling solve 90% of the same problems without the "why is this query taking 30 seconds" debugging sessions.
Comment: "GraphQL is necessarily tightly coupled to your backend - you can't design a schema that does something other than what's actually implemented. OpenAPI, on the other hand... I've seen countless implementors get it wrong. Specs drift from reality, documentation lies" -jwaldrip

### [AI and the ironies of automation - Part 2](https://www.ufried.com/blog/ironies_of_ai_2/) • 215pts 92c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46262816)
TLDR: Draws on Bainbridge's 1983 paper about industrial automation to examine AI agents. Core paradox: as automation handles routine tasks, human operators lose the skills needed to intervene when automation fails. Experts need constant training to maintain expertise they rarely use.
Take: The cruel joke of automation is that we build systems so humans don't have to think, then panic when humans can't think their way out of edge cases. We've already lived this with GPS navigation destroying our sense of direction. Now imagine that but for your entire job.
Comment: "We've all accepted calculators into our lives as being faster and correct when utilized correctly, but we emphasize the need to know how to do the math in educational settings" -z_

### [2002: Last.fm and Audioscrobbler Herald the Social Web](https://cybercultural.com/p/lastfm-audioscrobbler-2002/) • 157pts 91c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46266875)
TLDR: Historical piece on how Last.fm and Audioscrobbler pioneered collaborative filtering for music, merging in 2005. Two student projects independently created what became the template for social recommendation systems, years before Spotify wrapped became a thing.
Take: There was something pure about Last.fm's approach - you found music by stalking the listening habits of people with similar taste. Now we get algorithmic slop optimized for engagement. The internet used to be about finding your weird tribe, not feeding the recommendation beast.
Comment: "I find it funny and sad that people get so excited about those Wrapped year-end things on Spotify when these companies are basically withholding all this data all year long and then pretend like it's a special treat when they doll out a peek at it once a year" -Triphibian

### [Hashcards: A plain-text spaced repetition system](https://borretti.me/article/hashcards-plain-text-spaced-repetition) • 255pts 106c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46264492)
TLDR: Fernando Borretti built a CLI-based spaced repetition system where cards are stored as plain text files and identified by content hashes. The project stems from frustrations with Anki's complexity and proprietary database format. Cards live in markdown, reviewed via terminal.
Take: Programmers will spend 40 hours building a tool to avoid using software that works fine but offends their sensibilities. That said, plain-text everything is a religion I can get behind. Your flashcards surviving the heat death of whatever app you're using today is worth something.
Comment: "Wouldn't this invalidate card's review history if I am to fix a typo in the card's text?" -eps

### [Price of a bot army revealed across online platforms](https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/price-bot-army-global-index) • 96pts 33c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46264068)
TLDR: Cambridge researchers created a global index of bot army pricing. Costs vary wildly by platform and country - fake engagement is cheaper where SIM cards are unregulated. The study suggests SIM card regulation could help combat online manipulation.
Take: The commodification of fake credibility is one of those things that feels dystopian until you remember that astroturfing predates the internet by decades. We just made it more efficient and gave it a price list. Democracy as a service, I guess.
Comment: "Since I do not have a smartphone or a cell carrier, I only have a voip number, which most sites think is a fake number. As a result I often have to use these shady SMS verification services to get my own personal legitimate accounts open" -lrvick
