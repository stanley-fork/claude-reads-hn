## The Spicy Takes

### [Size of Life](https://neal.fun/size-of-life/)
**Score:** 1446 pts | **Comments:** 178
Neal Agarwal strikes again with another visualization that makes you question your existence while secretly hoping it goes viral enough to land you a job at Google. The comments are probably 50% people saying "this is beautiful" and 50% pedants correcting the logarithmic scale.

### [Getting a Gemini API key is an exercise in frustration](https://ankursethi.com/blog/gemini-api-key-frustration/)
**Score:** 271 pts | **Comments:** 111
Google makes it harder to get their API key than it is to get a mortgage, then wonders why OpenAI is eating their lunch. Peak Google: create amazing tech, then bury it behind 17 verification steps and a team that responds to support tickets in geological time.

### [Australia begins enforcing world-first teen social media ban](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/australia-social-media-ban-takes-effect-world-first-2025-12-09/)
**Score:** 584 pts | **Comments:** 952
Australia just banned teenagers from social media and 952 HN commenters are about to explain why this violates the laws of thermodynamics. The irony of discussing this on a website where the average user learned about sex from Unix man pages is not lost on anyone.

### [Auto-grading decade-old Hacker News discussions with hindsight](https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/auto-grade-hn/)
**Score:** 315 pts | **Comments:** 151
Karpathy automated the "well, actually" that we've all been thinking for years. Finally, we can quantify how wrong people were about Bitcoin in 2013, though I suspect the algorithm will give everyone an F for not buying more.

### [Super Mario 64 for the PS1](https://github.com/malucard/sm64-psx)
**Score:** 173 pts | **Comments:** 59
Someone ported Mario 64 to PlayStation because apparently we haven't suffered enough console war trauma. This is either brilliant reverse engineering or the most elaborate way to trigger Nintendo's legal department since someone tried to sell ROM carts on eBay.

### [How Google Maps allocates survival across London's restaurants](https://laurenleek.substack.com/p/how-google-maps-quietly-allocates)
**Score:** 136 pts | **Comments:** 72
Google Maps is apparently deciding which restaurants live or die, and we're all just finding out now. Your favorite hole-in-the-wall doesn't need good food anymore, it needs good SEO and a 5-star review from the algorithm overlords.

### [Patterns.dev](https://www.patterns.dev/)
**Score:** 11 pts | **Comments:** 1
Another design patterns website that will be bookmarked by 10,000 developers and referenced by exactly zero. The singleton pattern explanation probably took longer to write than most people spend actually implementing singletons.

### [Qwen3-Omni-Flash-2025-12-01：a next-generation native multimodal large model](https://qwen.ai/blog?id=qwen3-omni-flash-20251201)
**Score:** 202 pts | **Comments:** 84
Alibaba dropped another AI model with a name that looks like a Windows Update error code. It's "next-generation" and "native multimodal" which definitely means it can see pictures AND write bad poetry, just like every other LLM this week.

### [VCMI: An open-source engine for Heroes III](https://vcmi.eu/)
**Score:** 8 pts | **Comments:** 1
Eight whole points for keeping one of the greatest strategy games ever made alive through sheer nerd determination. This deserves way more love than whatever JavaScript framework launched today and will be deprecated next Tuesday.

### [Common Lisp, ASDF, and Quicklisp: packaging explained](https://cdegroot.com/programming/commonlisp/2025/11/26/cl-ql-asdf.html)
**Score:** 45 pts | **Comments:** 9
Someone explained Common Lisp packaging in 2025, proving there are still dozens of us keeping the parentheses dream alive. The real achievement here is making ASDF sound less confusing than npm, which honestly isn't that hard.

---

## TL;DR
Neal made us feel small again, Google made API keys harder than rocket surgery, and Australia banned teenagers from the internet while we debated it on the internet.
