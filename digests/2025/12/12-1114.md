### [The tiniest yet real telescope I've built](https://lucassifoni.info/blog/miniscope-tiny-telescope/) • 107pts 21c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46241763)
TLDR: French developer Lucas creates a pocket-sized Dobsonian telescope that actually works, using 3D printing and a 76mm mirror. Thing fits in your jacket and can resolve spider web strands after some mirror refiguring.
Take: Peak engineering autism in the best possible way. While everyone's debating whether to use React or Vue, this guy's machining optics in his spare time.
Comments:
- "I almost considered reflaboring the exahenge, but of course it would be a ridiculous prospect for a project of this type. I reflabored the exahenge." -Nition

### [4B If Statements](https://andreasjhkarlsson.github.io//jekyll/update/2023/12/27/4-billion-if-statements.html) • 23pts 5c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46174114)
TLDR: Developer sarcastically implements the world's most inefficient even/odd checker using 4 billion if-statements instead of modulus, creating a 40GB binary that actually works. Claims it's inspired by "fresh programmer blood" from TikTok.
Take: This is what happens when you combine technical skill with terminal brain damage from social media. Beautiful disaster.
Comments:
- "Amazing!" -SiempreViernes (on 10-second execution time for checking if 4 billion is even)

### [Guarding My Git Forge Against AI Scrapers](https://vulpinecitrus.info/blog/guarding-git-forge-ai-scrapers/) • 34pts 21c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46241849)
TLDR: Developer fights back against AI scrapers hoovering up their Git repositories by implementing automated bot detection and misdirection techniques. Claims to have reduced server load from 200W to 160W.
Take: Finally, someone treating AI scrapers like the digital locusts they are. Corporate data theft deserves garbage data in return.
Comments:
- "Gitea has a builtin defense against this, `REQUIRE_SIGNIN_VIEW=expensive`, that completely stopped AI traffic issues for me" -mappu

### [You are dating an ecosystem](https://www.razor.blog/2025/12/you-will-never-be-in-two-person.html) • 7pts 0c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46242513)
TLDR: Modern relationships aren't between two people anymore but between two algorithmic ecosystems of social media, therapy apps, and digital influences. Every disagreement gets filtered through someone's TikTok feed first.
Take: Depressingly accurate. Your girlfriend isn't mad at you, she's mad at the collective consciousness of her Instagram therapy accounts.

### [He set out to walk around the world. After 27 years, his quest is nearly over](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2025/12/05/karl-bushby-walk-around-world/) • 125pts 63c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46182874)
TLDR: Karl Bushby has been walking around the entire planet for 27 years and is finally approaching the finish line. Not continuous hiking - he takes breaks and returns to where he left off.
Take: Imagine having this much commitment to anything. Meanwhile I can't even finish reading the articles I bookmark.
Comments:
- "It was not one continuous hike. He takes frequent breaks. But travels back to where he last stopped and continues." -bolasanibk
